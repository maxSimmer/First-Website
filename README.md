# First-Website
* First website replicating a tech business selling products.
* Stack: HTML, CSS, and Javasript
* Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMck70tLDuo&t=462s

** Just basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and JS.
** Mostly front-end, not a lot of backend.
** Created this to review HTML and CSS before moving onto JS.
